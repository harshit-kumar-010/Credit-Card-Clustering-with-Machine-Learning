# Credit Card Clustering with Machine Learning



## Overview

This project demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning and data analysis through the implementation of credit card clustering techniques. By leveraging a dataset containing various customer attributes and purchase behaviors, I applied clustering algorithms to group credit card holders based on their financial habits, credit limits, and other relevant factors.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and includes features such as customer ID, balance, purchase frequency, credit limit, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for the clustering analysis, allowing for insights into customer segmentation.

## **Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to showcase my ability to perform advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks, specifically in the domain of customer segmentation. By effectively clustering credit card customers based on their financial attributes, this project demonstrates my capability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

## **Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook


## **Key Achievements**

Conducted thorough data exploration to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
Implemented data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Utilized machine learning algorithms to perform clustering analysis on credit card customers.
Generated insights into customer segmentation based on financial attributes and purchase behaviors.

**Future Enhancements**

Explore additional clustering algorithms to further refine customer segmentation.
Incorporate visualization techniques to present clustering results in a more intuitive manner.
Conduct A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of marketing strategies targeted at specific customer segments.
